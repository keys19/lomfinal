        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>
            The UAE has undergone significant societal and economic transformations over the years. The discovery of oil in the mid-20th century brought unprecedented wealth and development to the region, leading to a rapid modernization process. The UAE, comprising seven emirates, evolved from a predominantly nomadic society to a global hub of commerce and culture.  Socialization in gender roles was clear and divided, with women taking their roles inside the household and men holding the power both inside and outside the household. Before the oil era, the realm of the private versus public was clearly divided. Nowadays, women increasingly participate in the workplace and share the public sphere with men.(Sabban 2)
        </p>
        <p>
            As the economic landscape shifted, so did societal norms.  The concept of informal social networks transcends nationality, class, and language, serving as invaluable care networks that provide not only emotional support but also practical assistance, including social and financial aid.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Informal social networks exist across registers of nationality, class and language where they act as care networks and conduits of information, social and financial assistance (Kathiravelu 2012: 110). Even for undocumented migrants or visa over stayers, they help them moving up in the social mobility, providing care through advice and counselling.(Saxena 8)
        </p>

        <p>
            These informal networks operate as conduits of information, advice, and counseling, proving especially crucial for undocumented migrants or visa overstayers. In the protagonist’s situation, the support she received went beyond the formalities of legal documentation. The network offered her guidance on navigating the complexities of life in the UAE as a single woman, helping her overcome obstacles and providing the stability necessary for her to build a life in a new country.
        </p>

        <p>
            Migration is a very complex process that brings out power relations and hierarchies in terms of gender, generation, ethnicity, race, nationality, skills and many other socio-economic indicators. Increasingly, the role of women in this process is witnessing an upward spike – and thus, effectively, the number of women migrating is going up.This is more so the case with young women migrating from South Asian countries to the Gulf nations. With this rise in demand for migrant women in receiving countries– the overall effect has been that of an increase in the opportunities available to such young migrant women. This, in turn, is empowering them and freeing them from the erstwhile shackles of gender, generation, and other power relations (Saxena 36).
        </p>

        <p>
            The shifting societal dynamics in the UAE, especially for women, align with the broader trend observed in South Asian migrant communities. The rise in demand for migrant women has not only created opportunities but has also challenged traditional power relations, liberating women from societal constraints. This shares thematic parallels with the character Zouina from the film <i>Inch'Allah Dimanche.</i> Both narratives unfold against the backdrop of migration, cultural adaptation, and the quest for personal freedom in a new environment. The migration of both Zouina and Hina is initially motivated by love and the desire for family togetherness. Their journeys begin with the hope of strengthening familial bonds and creating a harmonious life with their husbands. Zouina in <i>Inch'Allah Dimanche</i> discovers a supportive community within her Algerian diaspora in France. These connections become her anchor as she grapples with an abusive marriage. The communal ties and shared experiences provide emotional support and practical assistance, allowing her to adapt to the unfamiliar French environment. Yet, despite the thematic similarities, the stories diverge significantly. Hina, being educated and hailing from a more developed region, introduces unique circumstances and challenges into her reality.

        <p>The interviewee for this narrative migrated to the United Arab Emirates in 2008 to reunite living with her ex-husband who was working in the UAE since 2000.</p>

        <h2>Footnotes</h2>
        <div>Growing up as a child of immigrants in the UAE, a country I consider my own despite not having legal citizenship, I've always been surrounded by the effects of migration. Being a third-culture kid with Indian parents who were raised in different continents—my mother in Africa and my father in India—I've encountered a rich tapestry of cultural influences. Amidst the myriad migration stories I could share, I've chosen to spotlight one that is particularly recent and close to my heart.</div>

        <div>The protagonist of this narrative is one of my mother's dearest friends—a woman I regard as one of the strongest and most inspiring individuals I know. I've had the unique privilege of witnessing her journey unfold right before my eyes, from the poignant decision to send her son to boarding school to navigating a challenging separation and subsequently building her own business.</div>
            
        <div> What captivates me most about her story is her unwavering resilience. Despite facing the complexities of living alone in the UAE, she approaches each day with a radiant smile, consistently expanding her business and honing her skills. Her determination to provide the best possible future for herself and her son is truly remarkable.</div>
        <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> Since this subject is sensitive, I was quite anxious to conduct the interview. After a complete run through of the questions with Professor, I gained some confidence but was still scared of triggering emotions or memories. However, my interviewee was so strong and unaffected that she answered all my questions with the biggest smile. The only weak point was when she spoke about her family back in India and how she still misses her son who studies away. </div>

        <h2>The Narrative</h2> -->
          <!-- <p>Amid the quiet hum of the evening, as the city lights of Mumbai cast a warm glow over their Skype conversation, Hina's voice emerged with a quiet resolve. </p>
          <p>"I've been pondering this, and I believe the time has come for me to consider Dubai. The space between us is more than just miles; it's a gap in Shubh's world where he longs for his father and, for me, a yearning for the presence of my husband. The distance, once a mere inconvenience, now feels like an uninvited guest in our lives." </p>
          <p>The decision lingered in the air, heavy with the weight of anticipation, as Hina's words marked the beginning of a journey beyond the confines of their current reality.</p> 
        <img src="images/dance.png" alt="Bottom Right Image" class="bottom-right">

      <section id="narrative2">
        <div class="dxb-bg">
            <p>In the vibrant rhythm of Mumbai's bustling streets, Hina and her toddler, Shubh, crafted a haven of happiness. Their days unfolded in the warm embrace of domestic bliss, with market strolls and playful afternoons in the local parks. Yet, as the echoes of Shubh's laughter filled their home, a yearning for more, for the presence of Hina's husband, stirred within her."Himansh, I believe this is the right step for our family. Shubh needs you, and I miss you," Hina pleaded through the pixelated screen, her eyes reflecting the determination that burned within her. "Fine, but I can't promise I'll be there all the time, Hina. Dubai demands, and the hours are endless," Himansh admitted, his face etched with the weight of responsibility.
            </p>


            <p>
                The decision to move to Dubai became an inevitable progression, a response to the growing void that even Mumbai's charms couldn't fill. Little did Hina realize that this decision would open a new chapter, painted with the golden sands and limitless opportunities of the UAE.
            </p>
           
        </div>
            <p>
Two years into their marriage, the couple finally decided to take the plunge and relocate Hina and their toddler to the UAE. Stepping onto the soil of a foreign land for the first time, it wasn't just Hina's first international flight; it was a vivid shift in the entire color palette of her world. The energy of Mumbai was replaced by the polished glamour of Dubai's urban sprawl, and the scent of familiar spices gave way to the cosmopolitan fragrance that hung in the new air. 
            </p>

            <p>
            While all was good and the family reunited, loneliness crept in subtly, like the shadows that stretched across the vast desert landscape. The expansive cityscape, though awe-inspiring, seemed to amplify the silence that enveloped her apartment during the long hours when Himansh was at work. Shubh, her ever-cheerful companion, started attending school, leaving Hina to grapple with her solitude.Days turned into weeks, and the loneliness persisted but she didnt complain, at least the family was together. Hina explored the city, trying to forge connections with other expatriates to move forward with her monotonous days. 
            </p>

            <p>
                A few years later, their household was shadowed by a dark cloud of their differing opinions. Initially, they sincerely tried to work through and resolve these disagreements. Unfortunately, as time passed, the situation took a negative turn. Simple conversations turned into heated arguments, and the verbal discord eventually escalated to the point of domestic abuse. Recognizing the detrimental impact on their child, Hina made a difficult yet courageous decision.
            </p>

            <p>
                She opted to send their son to a boarding school, sparing him from the distressing environment at home. "Sorry, Shubhu, Mumma loves you," Hina whispered with tearful eyes, explaining that it was a temporary measure to provide him with stability and a chance to focus on studies. Shubh, though confused, nodded with a hint of understanding. "But Mumma, I want to be with you and Papa," he said, his innocent eyes reflecting a mix of confusion and longing. As they shared a heartfelt embrace, Hina reassured him that, no matter the distance, they would always be a family. A bittersweet necessity made with the hope of shielding Shubh from the storm within their home.

        <section id="narrative3">
            <p>
                As Shubh embarked on his new chapter at the boarding school, the troubled dynamics between Hina and Himansh reached a breaking point. Shubh's absence served as both a painful reminder of their shared responsibilities and a brief respite from the tumult at home. However, as the situation worsened, Hina sought solace outside her troubled household, immersing herself in spiritual group sermons and expanding her small-scale catering business. That evening, as she rehearsed what she needed to convey to Himansh, anxiety and anticipation hung in the air. Opening the door to find him in tears, she asked with concern, “What happened? Is everything alright?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I lost my job, Hina. I lost it all. How will we survive in this chaotic city? How will we pay for Shubh's future? How will I face the world? I'm such a failure,” he confessed. Hina, torn between the weight of contrasting emotions, reassured him, “No, Himansh, you're not. This is just a challenge for us, and we will overcome it together.” The gravity of her words was palpable, yet not as heavy as the guilt she felt for contemplating leaving Himansh just when he faced job loss. Despite the emotional turmoil, Hina took on the responsibility of supporting and managing the household through her cooking endeavors. Working tirelessly day and night, she accepted order after order to make ends meet, determined to navigate the storm and provide a semblance of stability for their family. 
            </p>

            <p>
                With Himansh securing a new job, Hina stood on the brink of a challenging decision amidst the scrutinizing eyes of public opinion. Digging deep for courage, she resolved to take the bold step of initiating a separation and eventually filing for divorce from Himansh
            </p>

            <p>
                Now facing the challenges of a new chapter, Hina stood at a crossroads. The questions loomed large – where would she go, and how would she navigate the path ahead?
            </p>

            <p>
                She made a resolute choice to continue living in the UAE, a decision influenced by a multitude of factors that had gradually transformed the country into a home more profound than her native India over the course of 15 years. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Hina's mom was fervently insisting on her daughter's return to India, emphasizing the familial comfort awaiting her. "Hina, beta, come back home” However, with a determined gleam in her eyes, Hina responded, "Mom, I appreciate your concern, but my journey is here in the UAE. The opportunities and the life we've built are valuable. I believe in facing challenges head-on, and this is where I can offer Shubh the best future. I need to stay and continue my path here."
            </p>

            <p>
                As Hina continued to build her life in the UAE, she faced unexpected challenges that put a strain on her relationships and tested her resilience. The societal pressure to conform to traditional roles and expectations weighed heavily on her, especially as a woman navigating a career and single motherhood. She found herself grappling with deeply ingrained stereotypes, both within her own community and the broader society. The Indian stereotypical belief that a single woman couldn't live alone, especially in a foreign country, cast its shadow over her journey with The prevailing belief that a woman's place was within the safety net of familial structures. 
            </p>

            <p>
                While all the optimism is great, there was a reality check! How can one survive in this country with the meager income from a small scale catering business? 
 No longer eligible for a husband dependent visa, she faced the daunting prospect of leaving behind the life she had painstakingly built.  
            </p>

            <p>
                In the hustle and bustle of Hina's catering business, a sudden blow struck as a key client, pivotal to her success, abruptly withdrew their support. The domino effect unfolded swiftly, causing a cascade of lost clients and pushing Hina to the edge of financial ruin.
In this challenging moment, a well-off family, who had long admired Hina's culinary talents, stepped in. Recognizing her potential, they not only offered financial support but also provided a crucial work visa, allowing Hina to continue her business in the country she had come to call home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Armed with renewed courage, Hina decided to take a bold step to regain her standing in the culinary scene. She chose to participate in a prestigious food fair, showcasing her skills and determination to a wider audience. The gamble paid off as the exposure garnered attention, attracting more long-term clients eager to experience Hina's culinary expertise. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In the background, UAE’s economic landscape was shifting and, so were societal norms. Hina found herself in a country where women were increasingly participating in the workplace and sharing the public sphere with men.  From the brink of financial ruin, Hina not only rebuilt her catering business but also expanded her clientele, transforming adversity into an opportunity for growth and success. In a heartfelt conversation with her family, Hina poured out her thoughts,
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here in the UAE, the opportunities are like doors swinging wide open—like participating in the food fair and gaining exposure to advanced technology, with friends who support me by helping at the food stalls and forcing me to grow—that I wouldn't have back in India. Living alone here has propelled me to enroll in yoga and computer classes, not just for skill-building but for my overall well-being."
            </p>

            <p>
                As Hina unfolded her thoughts, she expressed, "If I were back in India right now, the demoralizing judgment from neighborhood aunties would drown out my every move. They'd fixate on societal expectations, questioning the choices of a woman living independently. The whispers of how I've supposedly wasted 15 years of my life in a foreign country or the persistent suggestions to reconcile with Himansh for my supposed well-being, or even the constant pressure to consider remarrying, would be relentless."
            </p>

            <p>
                "In this haven away from those judgments, I am free," she continued, "free to shape my own narrative and pursue my aspirations without the suffocating scrutiny. However, as liberating as it is, my mother's insistence on remarriage now places me at another crossroads. The question looms large – do I take the step of settling down again, conforming to societal expectations, or do I continue forging my path of independence?" Hina found herself grappling with the complexity of her choices, torn between societal norms and the freedom she had come to cherish.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hina's journey unfolds against the backdrop of the UAE's golden sands—a story woven with threads of migration, independence, and resilience. From contemplating Dubai to facing domestic turmoil and career challenges, Hina embodies the strength of a single woman navigating a foreign land. The UAE transforms into a supportive sanctuary where opportunities blossom and independence thrives. Yet, societal expectations cast shadows over Hina's path, creating a poignant struggle. The bustling streets of Mumbai echo with Hina's laughter, but it's in the silence of her UAE apartment that she finds the courage to reshape her destiny. Hina stands at a crossroads once more, her choices reflecting the enduring spirit of a woman embracing her journey in the UAE—an ode to strength and resilience.
